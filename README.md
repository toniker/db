# Databases

This repository contains the project files for the Databases class taken in the 2022 winter semester. This repository contains the schema and structure of an application that handles multiple user's photo libraries, like Google Photos.

In this repository, the relational models are graphed and the schema is saved as a MySQL Workbench file (.mwb). As exercises, there are several SQL queries to gather often useful information from the database.
